# Marathon Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of marathon data, providing insights and trends based on various performance metrics. The goal of this project is to explore the data, identify patterns, and potentially predict marathon times based on various input factors.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis and modeling
- Visualization of key trends and insights
- Machine learning model (if applicable)

## Introduction
This repository contains an analysis of marathon data to explore patterns and trends in marathon performances. The primary objective is to understand the relationship between different factors such as age, gender, and training levels with marathon finishing times. The analysis aims to provide insights that could help runners improve their performance or understand the variables influencing race times.

## How It Was Done
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset used in this project includes marathon results from various races, including information such as runner's age, gender, race times, and more.

2. **Data Cleaning**: The raw data was preprocessed to handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and ensure proper formatting for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Key statistical methods and visualizations, such as histograms and scatter plots, were used to identify patterns and correlations between variables, like age, gender, and marathon times.

4. **Modeling**: (Optional) A machine learning model was built to predict marathon finish times based on various input features such as age, experience, and past performance.

5. **Results and Visualization**: The findings were visualized through various charts and graphs to make the insights easy to interpret. These visualizations highlight trends and outliers in the data.
